# Cochrane Library Crawler & Frontend

This project contains two parts:

1. **PHP Command Line Tool** — A simple PHP CLI application that crawls the Cochrane Library
   by topic, collects metadata for each review, and saves the results to a file.

2. **React Frontend** — simple UI to browse/search reviews from JSON.
## Requirements

### PHP Crawler
- PHP **8.1+**
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Internet connection (the crawler fetches live data from Cochrane)
### React FrontEnd
- Node.js **(optional)** if you want to run a local static server
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
---
## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnboseman/vantage.git

```

## How to Use the Crawler

The PHP crawler lets you interactively fetch topics and reviews from the Cochrane Library and save them to a file.

### 1. Run the crawler
From the project root:

```bash
php crawler.php
```
### 2. Select the topic
When the program starts, you’ll see a numbered list of available topics:
```bash
==============================
 Welcome to the Cochrane Crawler
==============================

Select a topic to fetch reviews:

0. Allergy & intolerance
1. Blood disorders
2. Cancer
...
36. Wounds
```
Type the number of the topic you want and press `Enter`:
```bash 
Enter the number of your choice: 0
```
### 3. Fetch reviews
The crawler will connect to the Cochrane site, follow pagination, and display progress:

```bash
Fetching results for 'Allergy & intolerance'...
-> Processing page 1 of 3
-> Processing page 2 of 3
-> Processing page 3 of 3
63 reviews have been found.
```
### 4. Save the results
You’ll then be prompted to enter a filename:

```bash
Enter a filename to save the results (e.g. cochrane_reviews.txt):
```

You can enter **any filename you like** (with or without an extension).  

For example:

- `cochrane_reviews.json`
- `allergy_results.txt`
- `reviews_output`

The crawler will create a file with that name in the project directory containing all reviews for the selected topic.

### 5. Use the results

The saved file can be opened in any text editor.

# React Frontend
## Requirements
- Node.js **16+**
- npm or yarn
- 
---

## Setup

1. Make sure you have a JSON file generated by the crawler (e.g. `cochrane_reviews.json`).
2. Place the file where the app expects it (default: `public/js/cochrane_reviews.json` or alongside `index.html`).

---

## Running the app

Since this project uses plain React with an `index.html` entrypoint, there’s no build step. You have two options:

### Option 1: Open directly
- Double-click `index.html` in your file explorer.
- Or right-click → “Open With” → your browser.

### Option 2: Serve locally
For better compatibility (especially with `fetch()` calls), serve with a local HTTP server:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server 3000

# Or using Node (install once with npm -g)
npx serve .
```
